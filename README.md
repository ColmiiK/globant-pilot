# Globant Full-Stack Piscine

In this repository you'll find all the projects that we did during the Globant Full-Stack Piscine at 42 Málaga. Durint the two weeks, we developed multiple web projects, mainly front-end with a bit of back-end. Not all of them are complete, and most of them are quite ugly, but the spirit of the piscine is to learn the web development in a way that aligns with the pedagogic needs of the 42 Network.

### PS: All of the projects from Image Gallery onwards require the use of API keys, meaning that in their current state, they're non working. You will need to provide your own API keys

## 2048

Replicate the famous game [2048](https://play2048.co/) using Vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Image Gallery

Create an Image Gallery using Unsplash's API, in a way that allows users to authenticate, search photos and save them.
Also made with Vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.

## Trip Recommendator

Recommend a trip based on a prompt using Gemini AI. I took this project as an introduction to Django, that's why is mostly incomplete.

## PokéAPI

Generate a pokémon based on prompts and basic choices, also non-functional. Originally made with TypeScript and no Framework, it was then switched over to React.

## Globify

Replicate Spotify's UI and UX, authenticating with it's API to show the user's liked songs, playlists and more. I didn't do this project, but you can check one out on erivero-'s [repo](https://github.com/erivero-p/Globant_Piscine_Globify).

## Service DeskAI

Using React and Redux, create a ticketing service for broken objects. The back-end was done by [albagar4](https://github.com/albagar4) using MongoDB.
